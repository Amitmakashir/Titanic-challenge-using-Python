# Titanic-challenge-using-Python

My last attempt was in Matlab. This time I decided to go with Python and it was amazing. 
Python has some great libraries for Data Science and it's really easy to get started. 

I tried a bunch of different things this time. From extracting information from strings to plotting various graphs. 

This guy has done a great work with this dataset, some interesting insights.
